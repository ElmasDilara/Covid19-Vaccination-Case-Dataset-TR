**ABOUT DATASETS**

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic continues to threaten public health and this situation is raising great concern all over the world. With the development of different vaccines, it was aimed to end the epidemic and increase community immunity in the past years. The research reduced public anxiety but the extent of the impact of vaccines in the pandemic is should be under investigation. Because the degree of availability of the COVID-19 vaccines was differing both nationally and globally. This makes it important to investigate how effective vaccination is on the epidemic. The main aim of this study is to investigate the possible recovery impact of vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey.

First dataset (**COVID-19_vaccinesdata_TR**) that includes information about the total and daily cases, the total-daily deaths, the total-daily recovery, numbers of seriously ill cases and the total-daily applied doses was collected from the website of the Ministry of Health of Turkey.

Second dataset (**Avg_Seriouslyill_Vaccine(Jan-June**)_TRdataset) that includes information about  average daily recovery, average monthly dose 1 and 2, and the average seriously ill cases. In this dataset, we had so limited data range for a valid detection. Because of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey's website stopped releasing statistics about seriously ill cases in the second half of 2021.
